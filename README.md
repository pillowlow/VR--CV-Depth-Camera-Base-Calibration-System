# Project Name: Unity-VR with RealSense and Python Server-Client System

## Abstract

This project integrates Unity VR(Meta all in one sdk) with a RealSense camera and a Python-based WebSocket server-client system to create a seamless interaction between the physical and virtual worlds. It allows users to adjust the virtual camera's position by grabbing and moving a Camera Anchor, which automatically updates all real object tracking anchors. The system also includes a calibration offset adjustment panel and modular server-client communication using JSON for data exchange, making it adaptable to various use cases, including object detection and real-time VR applications.

## Simple Demo

Below is a simple demo showcasing the core features of the system:
